# ARArduino
Interaction with 3d AR objects using Arduno board and sensors
### Prerequisites. What you need to reimplement the system
Hardware: Arduino board, breadboard, a couple of jump wires, two resistors,  t (KY-013) - and photosensors. Software: Arduino IDE, Unity, Vuforia, Uduino plug-in (https://marcteyssier.com/uduino/).  
### Installing
Hardware: 
Set up a circuit. Connect t and photosensor to 5V and analog pins (don't forget about resistors and ground)
Install Vuforia and add uduino plugin into the most recent unity editor. 
Choose your target for AR and create a license for your application 
test your target in unity 
set up communicaton between your board and unity editor via Uduino (https://marcteyssier.com/uduino/)
